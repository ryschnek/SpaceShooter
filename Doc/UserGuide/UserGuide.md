The game is played with controls as follows:<br/>
'A' - Left movement <br/>
'D' - Right movement<br/>
Left click to shoot<br/>
<br/>
The objective is to dodge as many asteroids as possible or to shoot them down and survive. The user has 3 lives. Each collision with an asteroid removes some health, and after a while when health is very low, you can lose a life. 3 lost lives result in the game ending. Powerups are spawned randomly in the game to boost bullets and health. Shooting several times over a small time span can lead to an overheat. Have fun!
